4840,packet switching
4841,suggested it for use in the ARPANET
4842,each packet includes complete addressing information
4843,"individually, sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery"
4844,"Each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers. It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet"
4845,"the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order, based on the packet sequence number"
4846,"The packet header can be small, as it only needs to contain this code and any information, such as length, timestamp, or sequence number"
4847,Routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table
4848,a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking
4849,a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication
4850,"connection-oriented operations. But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer"
4851,"supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching"
4852,"Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted"
4853,A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS
4854,1969
4855,Two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core
4856,"In the virtual call system, the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host"

4869,"were open standards with published specifications, and several implementations were developed outside DEC, including one for Linux"
4870,a data network based on this voice-phone network was designed to connect GE's four computer sales and service centers

4885,government agencies and large companies (mostly banks and airlines) to build their own dedicated networks
4886,private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network
4887,There were two kinds of X.25 networks. Some such as DATAPAC and TRANSPAC
4888,DATAPAC was developed by Bell Northern Research
4889,A user or host could call a host on a foreign network by including the DNIC of the remote network as part of the destination address
4890,AUSTPAC was an Australian public X.25 network operated by Telstra
4891,"supporting applications such as on-line betting, financial applications"
4892,"Access can be via a dial-up terminal to a PAD, or, by linking a permanent X.25 node to the network"
4893,was the public switched data network operated by the Dutch PTT Telecom
4894,Datanet 1 only referred to the network and the connected users via leased lines
4895,public PAD service Telepad (using the DNIC 2049
4896,use of the name was incorrect all these services were managed by the same people within one department of KPN contributed to the confusion
4897,The Computer Science Network
4898,"to extend networking benefits, for computer science departments at academic and research institutions that could not be directly connected to ARPANET"

4907,it developed into a major part of the Internet backbone
4908,The Very high-speed Backbone Network Service
4909,provide high-speed interconnection between NSF-sponsored supercomputing centers and select access points in the United States
4910,The network was engineered and operated by MCI Telecommunications under a cooperative agreement with the NSF
4911,"By 1998, the vBNS had grown to connect more than 100 universities and research and engineering institutions via 12 national points of presence with DS-3"
4912,vBNS installed one of the first ever production OC-48c (2.5 Gbit/s) IP links in February 1999 and went on to upgrade the entire backbone to OC-48c
