# Bayesian GPT-2 Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a GPT-2 model enhanced with Bayesian techniques using PyTorch and `torchbnn`. The notebook `bayes_gpt.ipynb` demonstrates the integration of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) with GPT-2 for uncertainty estimation and improved generalization.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to explore the combination of generative models (specifically GPT-2) with Bayesian neural networks. This allows the model to estimate uncertainty in its predictions, providing more reliable outputs in scenarios where data is scarce or noisy.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.x
- `torch`
- `torchbnn` (Bayesian Neural Networks library for PyTorch)
- `transformers` (Transformers library)
- `pandas`
- `tqdm` (for progress bars)
- [Optional] Distributed training libraries from PyTorch for multi-GPU training
